AS PERGUNTAS SAO SOBRE OS LOGS. TEM QUE SE FAZER PARSING DOS MESMOS COM UM PROGRAMA PARA OBTER INFO ACERCA DAS DIVERSAS DISTRIBUICOES
QUE ELE VAI PERGUNTAR.

O programa tem de ser feito a mao em (C, python, whatever ..) ou usar excell. Tem de ler o log, para ver a "cummulative distribution".
Count number of lines that have PR smaller than 0, between 10 and 20, 30 and 40, 50 and 60.
Define percentage of values where Pr < -120 or Pr < -110.

DEFINE OUR OWN NETWORK:
Define another  repeater.
Find a place to position the new repeater.
Minimize area without coverage.
Find areas with lowest coverage, place an antenna in the highest spot of that place. Simulate coverage and try again.
(Trial and error)

Number of locations = number of pixels = number of lines.

Everything is centered around counting the lines in the logs.

--> Locations with no coverage and highest places <--
--> more pixels, more lines, better coverage <--

Make histograms with data about good or bad coverage.
